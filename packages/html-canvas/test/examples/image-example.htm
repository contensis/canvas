  Without the support of Funds and Pools as Founders, the Frameworks wouldn&rsquo;t exist. The Founders are at the heart of every Framework; from shaping the
  specification of services through to evaluating the Provider responses. To date 49 Funds and Pools have acted as Founders, often multiple times and on more
  than one Framework!
</p>
<p>
  If you feel able to volunteer to help shape the Frameworks as a Founder, or if you would like to find out more about this and the commitment involved, please
  do not hesitate to contact us.
